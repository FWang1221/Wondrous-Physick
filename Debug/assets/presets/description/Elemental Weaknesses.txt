This is a small addon allowing for the following interactions:

Maliketh heals from taking all forms of Death damage including Black Flame.

Godskin enemies heal from taking Black Flame damage but take huge amounts of damage when under Destined Death effects.

Black Flame, Ghost Flame, and Destined Death will instantly kill Godwyn-Death-Resultant-type enemies such as Skeletons, Mariners, and Cemetary Shades. Undead Beastmen don't count, however.

All main Erdtree-aligned bosses take extra damage from Frenzy but they'll hit much harder as a result and if applicable (and it makes sense), will enter Phase 2.

Bosses that wield swords will be Crossbow Parried when Clashed against.

Law of Regression knocks most bosses out of their second phase and changes the physical properties of enemies greatly.

Blood attacks heal blood-type bosses and enemies such as Mohg, Monstrous Blood Crows, Morgott, Bloody Fingers, etc.

Lightning attacks supercharge Leyndell Knights and makes them more prone to do special lightning attacks.

Ballista and Flamethrowers will attack on their own when crystal weaponry/spells hit them.

Scarlet Rot-type enemies have a chance to explode into a rot cloud if they get hit by Scarlet Rot. They will also heal if they are affected by Scarlet Rot.
